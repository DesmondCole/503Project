\title{Analysis of US Traffic Fatalities}

\section*{Introduction}
We analyze traffic fatality data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to assess various predictors of traffic fatalities and develop a limited profile of the circumstances associated with traffic fatalities.

\section*{Exploratory Analysis and Visualization}

\subsection*{Geographic Patterns}

\subsection*{Time Trends}
\textbf{Daily Cycle} \\
At the national and state level, the cycle of fatal accidents throughout the day is fairly consistent. There is a local maximum in the early morning, correlating with morning rush hour. Beginning just before noon, the level of fatal accidents rises consistently to peak at between 7 and 8PM, before declining steadily through to about 3 or 4 in the morning. \\

\\

With State-by-State plots, the daily fatal accident cycle is roughly similar, without significant change. The below plots show results from shape-based time series clustering of different states, according to daily fatal accident patterns. \\
