Overview:
This project is an overview of traffic fatality data provided by NHTSA. Our analysis surveys various predictors of high-fatality incidents, differences among automakers, and the geographic and date/time distributions of fatal collisions. 

Data:
2015-2016 US Traffic Fatality Records, published by NHTSA. Included in the dataset are various tables with information regarding the circumstances of vehicle crashes involving at least one fatality (where the death occurred within 30 days of the crash). The included information describes the circumstances of the crash, including environmental conditions, driver/occupant descriptions (including age and drug/alcohol test results), location, time of day, make/model of involved vehicles, and EMS response time.
