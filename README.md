Data:
2015-2016 US Traffic Fatality Records, published by NHTSA. Included in the dataset are various tables with information regarding the circumstances of vehicle crashes involving at least one fatality (where the death occurred within 30 days of the crash). The included information describes the circumstances of the crash, including environmental conditions, driver/occupant descriptions (including age and drug/alcohol test results), location, time of day, make/model of involved vehicles, and EMS response time.

Keep in mind:
-The consecutive number uniquely identifies an accident in a given year. Thus, a true unique accident identifier in the datasets in the zip file is the year-consecnumber combination.


To include in Analysis:
- Map of traffic fatalities by county, (ideally) weighted by population.
- Plot of traffic fatalities by time of day / time of week / season (to see periods with relatively high-fatality incidence.
- (potentially) time series clustering of weekly fatal traffic accidents by state, if returning decent results.
